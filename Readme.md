# Data Sources Example

In this project we will be seeing how to fetch data from external sources with the help of data sources.

## Steps

1. Fetch a ami id for a Ubuntu VM and create a EC2 instance. We will also see how we can fetch data like this from another region.
2. Next we will be fetching AWS account information and Region information. One is aws_caller_identity and the aws_region.
3. Next we will be using data sources to fetch VPC information.
